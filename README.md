# What impacts the HDI most?

The quest for optimal human development is an ongoing area of research for the past 100+ years. An interesting question is, what could accelerate the process faster? Is rural electrification more important than gender balance? While they both sound unrelated, it does matter when it comes to policy making. With limited resources, policy makers and development agencies always struggle in prioritising their funds. 

The  project aims to deploy machine learning to isolate the top factors and then build an inferentail model to see the impact of individual factors on HDI.

**Tableau Dashboard**
An interactive dashboard where individual factors could be adjusted to see it's effect on HDI can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/arasan8873#!/vizhome/WhatImpactsPoverty/Poverty).

**Predictors and Models**
The iterative imputer absed filling of null values, the machine learning model used to isolate the top factors, and the final output could be found [here](https://github.com/dataaivu/FinalProject_Bootcamp/tree/main/Jupyter_Notebooks).

**Data Collection and Cleaning**
28 years data from 7 different sources collected using API, web crawling and manual download. The notebooks and raw data can be found [here](https://github.com/dataaivu/FinalProject_Bootcamp/tree/main/raw_data).
